# Introduction

The Discord API is big.\
Bigger than what you see in the official API docs, at least.\
The purpose of this project is to cover all of it, from more in -- depth 
documentation to document entire new areas and endpoints, to make your 
understanding of the API and bot development better.

**Discord Developers** - <https://discord.gg/discord-developers> and <https://dis.gd/docs>\
Discord Developers (aka DDevs) is the official community dedicated to helping 
you with Discord's API. This server is a community for developers to support 
each other with some direct access to Discord staff who work on the Discord 
API and developer tools and features.

**Discord API** - <https://discord.gg/discord-api>\
Discord API (aka DAPI) is an unofficial server for discussing all facets of Discord's API, 
including bot creation, OAuth2, rich presence, and others.\
There are also channels for most libraries that currently interface with 
the API, allowing for discussion of those libraries.

**DDocs.io** - <https://discord.gg/HzJfeuUM5h> and <https://ddocs.io>\
DDocs.io is a collaborative effort between numerous library and large bot 
developers to collect, maintain and organise the summaries written on Discord 
Developers stage events as well as track upcoming API feature status! Many of 
us have found that writing GitHub Gists has been somewhat problematic in keeping 
up with each Q&A summary or feature, so instead of going through chain linking 
or the hell of searching where summaries are or what the status of a feature is, 
we'll be posting all of this onto a centralized website instead.

**Unofficial Discord API Docs** - <https://luna.gitlab.io/discord-unofficial-docs/>\
Unofficial documentation for Undocumented Discord APIs. Also contains an outline 
of Discord's infrastructure.

**Discord Resources** - <https://discord.gg/AJX6cVWeJg> or <https://discordresources.com/>\

resources for your Discord community!
