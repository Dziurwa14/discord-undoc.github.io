## Discord API

> **Description**: Discord API is *officially* an unofficial server for

> interface for the API, allowing for discussion of those libraries.

## ddocs.io

> **Description**: ddocs.io is a collaborative effort between numerous library
> and large bot developers to collect, maintain and organise the summaries
> written on Discord Developers stage events as well as track upcoming
> API feature status! Many of us have found that writing GitHub Gists
> has been somewhat problematic in keeping up with each Q&A summary or
> feature, so instead of going through chain linking or the hell of
> searching where summaries are or what the status of a feature is,
> we'll be posting all of this onto a centralized website instead.
