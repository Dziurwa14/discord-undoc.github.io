# Introduction

The Discord API is big.<br>
Bigger than what you see in the official API docs, at least.<br>
The purpose of this project is to cover all of it, from more in -- depth documentation to document entire new areas and endpoints, to make your understanding of the API and bot development better.

## Getting started

Generally people prefer to start from the gateway -- which isn't a wise choice.
From my (arHSM) experience it is better to start from the RESTful API.

The choice is your's, both the Gateway and the RESTful API are equally hard.

## FAQ

Is this official?<br>
No, we are not affiliated with Discord in any form of sorts.\
—

Are there any implememtation examples?<br>
No*. There are a lot of languages out there and it is nearly impossible to pick a language
that is easy to understand and translate to other languages.
Hence we only have explanations and some small examples in either TS, JS or Python,
mainly you will only see tables and JSON responses.\
—

Is there anyway to parse the API Types?<br>
The docs are written with parsing in mind, so yes you should be able to parse them.
The implementation might be a bit tricky but it should be easy.\
—


Can I use all these documented endpoints for my bot?<br>
No. The official documentation doesn't document these endpoint because they aren't useable by bots.
But some endpoints might be an exception.\
