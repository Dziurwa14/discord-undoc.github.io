## Discord Developers

## Discord API

Description: Discord API (aka DAPI) is an unofficial server for discussing
all facets of Discord's API, including bot creation, OAuth2, rich presence,
and others.\
There are also channels for most libraries that currently interface with
the API, allowing for discussion of those libraries.

## DDocs.io

Description: DDocs.io is a collaborative effort between numerous library and large bot
developers to collect, maintain and organise the summaries written on Discord
Developers stage events as well as track upcoming API feature status! Many of
us have found that writing GitHub Gists has been somewhat problematic in keeping
up with each Q&A summary or feature, so instead of going through chain linking
or the hell of searching where summaries are or what the status of a feature is,
we'll be posting all of this onto a centralized website instead.
